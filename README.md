# FastVoxelTraversal

This project is a simple program that implements fast voxel traversal in Python and provides visualization. It is an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper "[A Fast Voxel Traversal Algorithm for Ray Tracing](https://www.cse.yorku.ca/~amana/research/grid.pdf)"[1]. This project references the code from [fast_voxel_traversal](https://github.com/francisengelmann/fast_voxel_traversal).

## Dependencies:
- numpy
- open3d

## Execution:
To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
python ray_vis.py
```
